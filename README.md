# Hi there üëã

I'm Labib, a computer science student from Bangladesh, passionate about solving real-world problems through software. Currently interning at [Repsoft Consultancy Services](https://repsoft.in/). I specialize in building web applications and REST APIs.

I am proficient in `JavaScript/TypeScript` and its frameworks like `React/Next.js` and `Express`.

I have experience in databases like `MongoDB` and `PostgreSQL`.

I am also familiar with:

- `Git`
- `Linux`
- Common AWS services like `EC2` and `S3`.

I also know a bit of `Python`. I have developed basic web applications using `Flask`.

## üî≠ I‚Äôm interested on

Apart from web development, I'm deeply interested in computer science fundamentals. I am currently learning about algorithms and data structures, and interested in cybersecurity and AI/ML, especially how chess engines work (would like to build one one day).

Additionally, I'm a developer productivity enthusiast, experimenting with tools like NeoVim, FancyZones (Windows), Tmux, and always open to suggestions for improvement.
