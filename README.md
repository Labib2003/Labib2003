# 👋 Hi there, I'm Labib

I'm a final-year Computer Science student from Bangladesh, currently working at [Repsoft Global](https://www.repsoftglobal.com/). I specialize in backend infrastructure and full-stack development, with a focus on solving real-world problems through scalable, well-architected software.

I like to share small learning demos as I explore new tech—trying out best practices even in the tiniest projects. I think you might enjoy some of these micro builds, so feel free to check out my public repos!

## 💻 What I Do

- Build secure and scalable **web applications** and **REST/tRPC APIs**
- Design and deploy backend services using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**
- Architect containerized apps with **Docker**, and deploy to the cloud (primarily AWS)
- Experiment with **AI integrations** (LangChain, vector DBs, OpenAI SDKs)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Lua (basic)
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express, Hono, NestJS (learning)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **ORMs**: Prisma, Drizzle
- **API**: REST, tRPC, OpenAPI (in progress)

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3), Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infra-as-Code**: Terraform, Pulumi (learning)
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry (learning)

## 🎯 Currently Exploring

- Distributed systems & backend architecture (Kubernetes, streaming, caching)
- AI/ML integrations into full-stack apps
- Using `LangGraph` agents and vector DBs for smarter applications


## 🧠 Interests Beyond Code

- **Cybersecurity** – always curious about protocol exploits and system defense
- **Developer workflows** – from NeoVim to FancyZones, I’m all about speed + minimalism


## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On

- Full-stack projects using **Next.js**, **React**, or **Hono/Nest.js**
- Infrastructure-focused applications (CI/CD, monitoring, containerized deployments)
- Open source contributions that match my current stack or learning goals
